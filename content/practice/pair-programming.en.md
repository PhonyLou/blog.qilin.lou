What is the first thought in your mind when you heard the word "Pair Programming"?

Does that mean a fashion way to write code? Or it's a Flashy-Method?

I would like to share my experience in the past 6 months. During the time, my teammates and I have paired all the time to work out the production program.

# Practice and Benefits

Before joining a new team, I don't have any Pair Programming experience in my career. The beginning of everything is the slogan - _We always pair_. You can find the culture of pairing programming everywhere, like git commit message - "Implement xxx function, pair with xxx".


### How to find a pair

When a developer wants to pick up a card, no matter a story card or task, she hands up and says "Hey, I wanna this card, who can pair with me?". Then another developer from the team can reply to her and starts to work together.

### How to work

In pairing, there are two roles - driver and navigator. A pair write code in one machine, so they have to decide who can use the keyboard. Usually, the driver holds the keyboard and is responsible for writing code. Meanwhile, the navigator observes driver's actions and changes, and give suggestion.

Once finished a function, they change their roles. Now the navigator gets control of devices. The rotation rule can be aligned within the pair, sometimes it could be a section of function, and sometimes its a time box.

### Benefits

In pairing programming, a pair discuss with each other a lot, so they can make good designs and decisions. Especially in some sensitive operations, a delegated navigator can stop some stupid actions - such as *rm -rf /*

Another scenario is code review. Code from a pair can make sure at least two developers have work on it and go through it at the same time. This practice improves code quality.

One more thing is there's an explicit benefit to knowledge sharing.  Domain knowledge, programming skills, shortcut skills are welcome to share.

# Costs

Yet we are in a very beginning situation of paring, we have paid lots of costs for our practices.

### Criticize others

Yes, you need to point out the mistakes and bad smell code based on your feeling. You need brave to say "No" when you find something wrong.

And be careful, you should avoid falling into the trap of blaming others as well. It's more like a soft skill.

### Tired

Staying focused at all times is a very energy-consuming behavior. After a short time (maybe 1 hour) in pair programming, I will feel really exhausted. So set a time box would be a good choice.

### Velocity

This leads to a lot of arguments about pair programming. Supporters think there's a long term benefit for software quality, code review, knowledge sharing, and fast to onboard new members. 

But others think there's impossible 1 + 1 > 2. They (usually the management team) think the benefits of the pair programming cannot exceed the impact on the delivery velocity. 

For us, the velocity concern doesn't matter till now, so we will keep pairing.

Would you have a trial on pairing?
