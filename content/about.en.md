## Past several years

In my past career, I have taken various roles including R&D engineer, technical leader, Scrum Master, project manager, and solution architect.

I participated in the R&D tasks of many domestic and foreign(Non-China) projects and was also responsible for the delivery projects of Multinational bank and insurance companies.

My technology stack includes Java, Scala, AWS, microservice architecture, agile project management.


## Now

Currently, I am committed to improving the delivery capabilities of agile teams, from a **developer**'s perspective, including:

* Coding ability - Craft
* Architecture ability - Drawing blueprint
* Engineering Practice Ability - Construction Process

I spent a lot of time on project management, and now I change my way to focus on technical and delivery.

Of course, I also have many other interesting things, such as DDD, Functional Programming. Feel free to [mail me](mailto:louqilin555@gmail.com).
